# HumanCircadianRhythmsSimPackage
Tools for simulating human circadian rhythms for a given light schedule


This package contains python programs for simulating the single population, two population and van der Pol models for Human 
Circadian rhythms for a given light schedule. 

Dependencies:

This package makes use of the most recent versions of the following python libraries:

1. Numpy
2. scipy
3. pylab/matplotlib
4. pandas
5. numba

# Simulating Schedules:

The file compare_models_actograms contains tools for simulating the three models under basic light schedules including a Regular Light Schedule, Shift Work and jetlab (slam shifts). 

# Create your own light schedules

For each of the models you can pass in and defined light schedule with gives light levels in lux.
